This is my second iteration on the project0

It's a project in wich I'm actually working on, but adapted to fit the requirements of project0. Originally it's quite different. Anyway, it's a dj website for a big artist, you can listen to his musics and find contacts for shows, etc.


In this project I've used an open source project called Blueimp Gallery, it allows you to do really good looking gallerys and carousels quite easily, here's a link to the github page:
